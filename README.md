# ATM Withdrawal Behavior Analysis

This project explores ATM withdrawal behavior across 35 machines located in four Nigerian statesâ€”Kano, Enugu, Lagos, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Using a real-world dataset from Kaggle, I performed data cleaning, merging, exploratory analysis with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), and built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key trends.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, EDA
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Merging/joining datasets, calculating KPIs
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizing distributions and trends
- **Tableau**: Dashboard creation for insights storytelling

##  Key Insights

###  Transaction Overview
- **Total transactions:** 1,048,575  
- **Total amount withdrawn:** â‚¦18,478,995,000  
- **Average transaction amount:** â‚¦17,623  
- **Median transaction:** â‚¦10,000  
- **Mode transactions:** â‚¦50,000 (129,421 times), â‚¦100,000 (37,514 times)

###  Transaction Amount Distribution
- **Q1:** â‚¦6,000  
- **Q2 (Median):** â‚¦10,000  
- **Q3:** â‚¦20,000  
- **IQR:** â‚¦14,000  
- **Upper whisker:** â‚¦30,000  
- **Outliers:** â‚¦50,000 and â‚¦100,000 were disproportionately frequent, likely due to withdrawal limits or caps.

##  When Do People Withdraw?

- **Peak Hour:** 4 PM â€“ 5 PM  
- **Most Active Period:** 7 AM â€“ 6 PM  
- **Late Night (0â€“3 AM):** Almost no activity  

###  Monthly Trends:
- **Most Active Month:** January  
- **Least Active Month:** November

###  Day Trends:
- **Weekend Usage (Sat & Sun):** Slightly higher than weekdays  
- **Holiday Transactions:** Surprisingly high (1 million+) over just 8 holidaysâ€”suggesting festive rushes or salary events

##  Who's Withdrawing?

###  Gender:
- Female: 528,242 transactions  
- Male: 520,333 transactions

###  Top Occupations:
- Health Professionals (Female): 91,038  
- Students: 99,449 (Male & Female combined)  
- Traders, Lawyers, Engineers, Data Analysts also showed strong activity

##  Where?

### By State:
- **Kano:** 458,764 transactions (10 ATMs)  
- **Enugu:** 350,251 transactions (9 ATMs)  
- **FCT:** 159,652 transactions (6 ATMs)  
- **Lagos:** 79,908 transactions (15 ATMs â€” all underperforming)

### Underperforming ATMs:
- **17 ATMs flagged** as underperforming (below average of 26,214 transactions/year)
- Lagos machines averaged just **5,000â€“6,000 transactions**
- Notably low performers in FCT: Lugbe and Garki ATMs

---

##  Recommendations

- **Reassess ATM placement in Lagos:** Is access harder or demand genuinely lower?
- **Expand availability during peak hours (4â€“5 PM)** to reduce queue pressure
- **Redistribute or promote underused ATMs** to more strategic locations
- **Leverage customer segmentation** (e.g. students, professionals) for targeted service delivery

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
- Explore transaction *success/failure* if data becomes available
- Add clustering models for customer segmentation
- Incorporate real-time withdrawal predictions (if timestamp granularity improves)
